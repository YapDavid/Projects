    <br>

    <div><center><Justify>  I writing to tell you I am doing fine in school. Everything seems to going well and I have managed to make it to the second semester. Although the new subjects feel a little challanging I aim to pass them as well, I want not only grow as a student here but as well rounded person and individual.</Justify></center></div>

    <div><center> I know that we are all pretty busy at the moment but I hope as a family we can spend some quality time together when we can. Its important we can take some time of work and enjoy the little things in life. Learning how to balance work and enjoyment is a must, too much of one thing is never right. As you and Dad read this letter I hope we can arrange something soon with the whole family.  </center></div>
